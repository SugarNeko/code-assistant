Here's the analysis of your Protobuf file and answers to your questions:

1. **Go Import Path for Generated Code**:
   The generated code should be imported using:
   ```go
   import "code-assistant/proto/example"
   ```
   This comes from the `option go_package = "code-assistant/proto/example"` directive in the Protobuf file.

2. **Client-side Go Code for GetUser RPC**:
   Here's how to call the GetUser RPC in Go:
   ```go
   // Assuming you've already set up a gRPC connection
   client := example.NewUserServiceClient(conn)
   
   // Create the request with validation
   req := &example.UserRequest{
       UserId: 123, // Must be ≥ 1
   }
   
   // Call the RPC
   resp, err := client.GetUser(context.Background(), req)
   if err != nil {
       // Handle error (including validation errors)
   }
   
   // Use the response
   name := resp.Name
   email := resp.Email
   ```

3. **Field Constraints on UserRequest**:
   The `UserRequest` has one constraint:
   - `user_id` field must be greater than or equal to 1 (enforced by `[(validate.rules) = {int32: {gte: 1}}]`)
   This uses protoc-gen-validate to enforce that the user_id is a positive integer (≥ 1).

Additional notes:
- The package is declared as `hello.v2` in Protobuf namespace, but the Go package is `code-assistant/proto/example`
- The service imports google.protobuf.Timestamp (though it's not used in the shown messages)
- The validation rules come from the protoc-gen-validate plugin
