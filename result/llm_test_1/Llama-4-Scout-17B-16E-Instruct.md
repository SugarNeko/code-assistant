### Analysis of the Provided Protobuf

#### 1. How should the Go code import the code generated from this Protobuf?

To import the code generated from this Protobuf in Go, you would use the path specified in the `option go_package` directive. Given that `option go_package = "code-assistant/proto/example";`, your import statement in Go would look like this:

```go
import (
	"code-assistant/proto/example"
)
```

However, make sure that the generated protobuf Go code is in the correct location relative to your Go module's path. If your Go module is `github.com/yourmodule`, and assuming the protobuf compiler was run with the correct output directory, you might need to adjust your import path accordingly.

#### 2. How should the client-side Go code call the GetUser RPC service?

Assuming you have a client connection established to the server providing the `UserService`, and you've used a gRPC client library in Go (e.g., `google.golang.org/grpc`), here's a basic example of how to call the `GetUser` RPC service:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"code-assistant/proto/example"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
)

func main() {
	// Establish a connection to the server
	conn, err := grpc.Dial("your-server-address:50051", grpc.WithInsecure())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("did not connect: %v", err)
	}
	defer conn.Close()

	// Create a client instance
	client := example.NewUserServiceClient(conn)

	// Prepare the request
	req := &example.UserRequest{
		UserId: 123, // Ensure this ID complies with the validation rules
	}

	// Call the GetUser RPC
	resp, err := client.GetUser(context.Background(), req)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("could not get user: %v", err)
		return
	}

	// Handle the response
	log.Printf("User Name: %s, Email: %s\n", resp.Name, resp.Email)
}
```

Make sure to replace `"your-server-address:50051"` with the actual address of your server and ensure that the `UserId` you provide in the `UserRequest` complies with the field constraints defined.

#### 3. What field constraints have been applied to the UserRequest in the request?

The `UserRequest` message has one field, `user_id`, with a constraint applied:

```proto
int32 user_id = 1  [(validate.rules) = {int32: {gte: 1}}];
```

This constraint, defined using `protoc-gen-validate`, specifies that `user_id` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1 (`gte: 1`). This means any value of `user_id` less than 1 will be considered invalid according to these validation rules. 

To use this validation in your client or server, ensure you have integrated `protoc-gen-validate` into your protobuf compilation process, and you're using a compatible gRPC framework or library that enforces these validation rules.
